![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Maintenance-yellow)

## Overview
A sophisticated laboratory environment isolated for the purpose of analyzing malware behavior. It captures system calls, network activity, and file system changes in a controlled sandbox. This project focuses on identifying indicators of compromise (IoCs) and understanding the attack vectors of various malware strains.

## Core Capabilities
- **Sandbox Isolation**: Safe execution environment for malicious samples.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Monitoring API calls, registry changes, and network traffic.
- **Forensics**: Captures Wireshark pcaps and memory dumps for deep analysis.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Generates IoCs for firewall and EDR updates.

## Environment
- **Virtualization**: VMWare / VirtualBox
- **Analysis Tools**: Wireshark, Process Hacker, Regshot
