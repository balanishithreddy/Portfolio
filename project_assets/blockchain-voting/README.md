![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Restricted-red)

## Overview
A decentralized application (DApp) that leverages blockchain technology to ensure fair and transparent voting processes. By using Solidity-based smart contracts on the Ethereum network, it eliminates the possibility of double-voting and ensures that all results are permanently recorded and immutable.

## Features
- **Transparency**: Every vote is recorded on the public ledger.
- **Immutability**: Results cannot be altered once confirmed.
- **Identity Verification**: Secure Web3 identity management.
- **Decentralization**: No central point of failure or control.

## Technical Stack
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Network**: Ethereum / Polygon
- **Frontend**: Web3.js / React
